# The objective of this file is to set the state handling capabilities of the
# POMDP problem

# POMDP is ConnectPOMDP

"""

The ConnectPOMDP is specified over an `n` x `n` grid world, where `n` is the 
`n_grid_size` variable in the POMDP. There are `num_bots` total robots which
include the agents (followers) and passive robots (leaders). So, we have a 
(`n` x `n`) x `num_bots` state space.

Each state is an array of CartesianIndex for each robot.

Inputs:
    pomdp   The ConnectPOMDP instance

Outputs:
    ùíÆ       The full state space

Map a state (x, y) to a linear index. This function inherets from the POMDPs
stateindex funtion.
