"""
    The following function takes the current state of the system as an input 
    and returns the algebraic connectivity.

    It constructs the adjacency_matrix by adding to element (i,j) the connectivity
    between agents i and j. The connectivity is assumed non-binary, but spanning the range 
    (0,1). In order to do so, the distance between agents i and j is fed to a truncated gaussian
    (initialized by the corresponding parameters in the ConnectPOMDP structure).

    The degree_matrix is also determined and the laplacian_matrix = adjacency_matrix - degree_matrix 
    is finally used to get the algebraic connectivity (its second smallest eigenvalue).
